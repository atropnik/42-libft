# 42-libft
Core C funcs for 42 Silicon Valley and beyond

You will find many already written Mains here to conveniently test functions using just one file at a time. These mains are not a guarantee of passing - they are just a framework. Testing for extreme cases is up to you.

Functions without mains (with Makefile, etc.) are in all-without-mains. These are also the most stable, bug-free version of the functions.
