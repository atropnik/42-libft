# 42-libft
Core C funcs for 42 Silicon Valley and beyond

You will find many already written Mains in with-mains for testing just one file at a time. These mains are not a guarantee of passing - they are just a framework. Testing for extreme cases is up to you.

Most stable, up-to-date funcs in libft - do not trust funcs in with-mains without double checking. Other useful "ft" functions have been added as needed for subsequent projects.
